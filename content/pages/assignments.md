Pre-Class Surveys
-----------------

For most classes, a brief pre-class survey will be distributed the day before class. Survey responses are required, and should demonstrate familiarity with readings and case materials. Each student is responsible for answering each survey question.

Class Preparation Memos
-----------------------

Twice during the course, students must submit a two-page memorandum of analysis and recommendations for a case study or assigned reading. These memos are a team assignment, and can be completed in teams of up to four members. Each memorandum should be typed and double-spaced, 12 point font with one-inch margins. The two-page limit is for text only. You may attach as many numerical calculations or diagrams as you wish. Class preparation memos can be written for the following case studies or sessions.
